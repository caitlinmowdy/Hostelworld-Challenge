8184809,4453734,this hostel was pretty good the guy behind the counter was nice and helpful i would recommend that if you plan on going to bed early or sleeping through the night you should look for somewhere else to stay the walls here are very thin so if someone upstairs or next door is noisy you can hear it very clearly and it s difficult to sleep other than that it was a good experience great location near siziwan harbor and ferry terminal,41232,2012-03-02 13:15:04,English

10780911,4457334,i booked here because the hostel s own description says that the bar is away from the dorms so you can sleep i was kept awake until 1 00am even with earplugs that s not really late but then all kicked off again at 3 00am with diabolical music and shouting i checked out the next morning if you are looking for a loud party hostel with the sickly smell of hangover breath in your dorm in the morning then you will like vibes if you want to sleep book somewhere else,49980,2012-03-05 02:29:31,English
