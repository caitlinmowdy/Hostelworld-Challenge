The history of the street reaches to the early 1850’s and is connecting the city center with the suburb Penzing. The history of our house is stamped with the history of the drugstore “zum goldenen Schuh”, which exists since 1869, when the house was build. So you can expect a nice, classic old building with high ceilings. Our guesthouse is located in the 3rd floor, leaving behind the lively ambience of the pedestrian zone. There are many places to eat, including coffee houses (from Starbucks to the traditional Viennese), bars, bakeries, restaurants, deli's and family style establishments in the area and for this reason we have found out that our guests prefer to go out for breakfast. Therefore we do not serve breakfast. We provide a kettle and mugs in your room with coffee and tee bags for your first morning. There are no kitchen facilities available in the house. The Naschmarket is only a 10 min. walk away and it is open 6 days a week. You will find fresh fruit and vegetable stands, international deli's and food stalls offering inexpensive meals.
