The challenge proposed by Hostelworld is to build a recommendation engine for users. Recommendations can save travelers valuable time, improve their hostel experience, and increase user retention. This challenge will use user information, reviews, and hostel details.

Hostelworld currently lets users apply filters to their search. However, hostels with the same features and price range can still be very different. This is why hostelworld is proposing the challenge of building a recommendation engine that also takes into account review text and hostel descriptions.

## Details
Your solution should be able to recommend hostels for a given user, and give numeric values for the recommendations. The recommendation values should relate to what a user would leave as a reivew score if they stayed at that hostel. 

Your solution should be able to give a recommendation score for any hostel user combination. This is how your solution will be judged. You are given reviews for users that have left multiple reviews. We have saved some of those reviews to test your solution. The best solution will have the lowest sum of differences between recommendation scores and the review scores.

The data will include
-	User Information
-	User Reviews 
-	Hostel Details
